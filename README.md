# Tweet Sentiment Analysis using Naïve Bayes from Scratch

## Overview
This project implements **Sentiment Analysis** on tweets using the **Naïve Bayes classifier**, built from scratch in Python. Sentiment analysis is a **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** technique that determines whether a given text expresses a **positive, negative, or neutral** sentiment.

## Features
- ✅ Preprocessing of tweets (removal of stop words, punctuation, and special characters)
- ✅ Tokenization and vectorization of text data
- ✅ Implementation of Naïve Bayes classification from scratch (without libraries like Scikit-learn)
- ✅ Training and testing the model on labeled tweet datasets
- ✅ Evaluation of model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- ✅ Development of stream app for user interaction

## 📂 Dataset
You can use any labeled dataset containing tweets with sentiment labels (e.g., positive, negative, neutral). A commonly used dataset is the **Sentiment140 dataset** or any manually labeled Twitter dataset.

## 📦 Installation
Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas nltk
```

## 🚀 Usage
### 1️⃣ Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alishgiri369/tweet-sentiment-analysis-naive-bayes.git
cd tweet-sentiment-analysis-naive-bayes
```
